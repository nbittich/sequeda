# TODO order has been added because of a weird bug with 
# the upload service. upload route must be the last one to 
# be loaded, otherwise got a broken pipe (os 32) when
# trying to upload something.
# too much proxy stuff to dig now
# to investigate: `api` route + caddy + hyper + https
# frontend -> POST localhost:9000/api/uploads/**
#             -> Caddy => http://gateway/api/${segment}
#             -> Gateway => http://gateway/${segment} <- rewrite & redirect to itself
#             -> Gateway => http://uploads/${segment} <- redirect to uploads, broken pipe
# possible reason, when rewrite & redirect we should remove some header (e.g https proto)
# to redirect internally instead of going back to caddy (do we?)
